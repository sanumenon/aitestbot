However, here's a general outline of how to write functional test scenarios for a given web application using selenium and testng:\n\n1. Start by creating a new test class that extends the selenium web driver test base class.\n\n2. Create a new method in the test class that takes in the desired browser, such as chrome or firefox, and runs the desired test scenario.\n\n3. Define the test scenario by providing the desired test steps, such as opening the application, navigating to a specific page or location, performing a specific action, and verifying the expected output.\n\n4. Add the necessary selenium libraries and dependencies to the test class.\n\n5. Write the test code using selenium's built-in commands, such as \"click\" and \"sleep,\" to simulate user interactions.\n\n6. Test the functionality of the application under different scenarios, including different browser versions, devices, and logins.\n\n7. Write test reports to document the test results and identify any issues or defects.\n\n8. Use testng to run the test cases and generate reports.\n\n9. Use testng to run the test cases continuously and automatically, ensuring that the application is always running and working correctly.\n\nby following these steps, you can write functional test scenarios for a web application using selenium and testng."}, "2": {"input": "Generate test cases for Personal profile page  & settings page .

Open a new or existing Selenium IDE or Selenium Grid session.\n2. Create a new test using TestNG and set the test class name as \"PersonalProfilePageTest\".\n3. Create a new class in the \"src/test/java\" folder as shown below:\n\n```java\nimport org.testng.annotations.Test;\nimport org.testng.annotations.AfterMethod;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.By;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.remote.DesiredCapabilities;\nimport org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver;\n\npublic class PersonalProfilePageTest {\n\n  private WebDriver driver;\n\n  @BeforeMethod\n  public void setUp() {\n    DesiredCapabilities capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.firefox();\n    capabilities.setCapability(CapabilityType.LOCALE, \"en-US\");\n    driver = new FirefoxDriver(capabilities);\n    driver.manage().window().maximize();\n  }\n\n  @AfterMethod\n  public void tearDown() {\n    driver.quit();\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void testLogin() {\n    WebElement username = driver.findElement(By.name(\"username\"));\n    WebElement password = driver.findElement(By.name(\"password\"));\n    username.sendKeys(\"username\");\n    password.sendKeys(\"password\");\n    driver.findElement(By.xpath(\"//*[@id=\\\"login-form\\\"]/button\")).click();\n    Thread.sleep(1000);\n    WebElement profilePage = driver.findElement(By.linkText(\"Profile\"));\n    profilePage.click();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above code, we create a new test class called \"PersonalProfilePageTest\" and add a \"beforeMethod\" and \"afterMethod\" method to set up and tear down the test environment.\n\n4.
