// This code defines a Page Object Model (POM) class for a login page in a web application using Selenium WebDriver.
// It uses the PageFactory class to initialize web elements defined by their XPath.
// The class includes methods to interact with these elements, such as clicking buttons or entering text into input fields.
// Each web element is annotated with @FindBy to locate it on the page, and the methods are designed to perform specific actions based on the element's purpose.
// The template allows for dynamic generation of web element definitions and actions based on the provided parameters.
// The generated code can be used in a Selenium test to automate interactions with the login page.
// The elements are defined in a loop, allowing for multiple elements to be included in the page object.
// The actions for each element are determined by the `action` field, which can be either 'click' or 'enterText'.
// The `sampleText` field is used to provide a default text for input fields when the action is 'enterText'.
// The class can be extended or modified to include additional methods or elements as needed for the specific login page being tested.
// The generated code is saved in a file named after the class name with a .java extension
// in the 'generated_code' directory, making it easy to integrate into a larger test suite.
// The use of the Page Object Model pattern promotes better organization and maintainability of
// the test code by separating the page structure and interactions from the test logic.
// The class can be instantiated in a test class, allowing for easy interaction with the login page
// during automated testing.
